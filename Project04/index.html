<h2 class="div2-h2">Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>
<p class="div2-p">The sun floated over Oxford, struggling to permeate through the thick clouds. 
The half-naked trees danced to the cold gusts of wind that herald the coming of 
winter. It was gloomy. Miami students, though accustomed to the seasons of Oxford, 
felt something was off. The sentiments of the student body, echoing from classrooms to bars Uptown, 
were confirmed when Prsident Crawford announced a disturbing news later that evening. </p>

<h2 class="div3-h2">Chapter 2: The Evening</h2>
<p class="div3-p">The moon now dominated the sky of Oxford. The trees, now stripped from their leaves, 
stood still. It was a quiet night. Everyone was wondering what the President has to say as 
they wait around the hastily erected podium. The President, wearing a hazmat suit and surrounded by Oxford police officers, rushed through the crowd and onto the podium. He speaks into the mic: "I gathered you all here today 
to make an urgent announcement. Five Biology students at Miami have been infected by a human-engineered intentionally fast-spreading and deadly virus that broke out from a lab in Upham. No one will be able to enter 
and leave Oxford as per a recently instated emergency movement ban by the CDC." Students started looking at each other in 
shock. "Love and Honor," said the President as his closing statement before he rushes away from the podium.</p>
